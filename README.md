# sampleDataStructures

In this repository I want to save the Data Structures and Algorithms which I am studying and will be adding few more interesting coding problems I encounter. I have implemented on my favourite language Java. 

In the initial phase I will be providing implementations for the below mentioned, I will be adding other topics as and when I am preparing. 

Data Structures:
--------------------------
  * Stack / Queue (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/dataStructures/StackAndQueue.java)
  * Heap / Priority Queue (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/dataStructures/MinAndMaxHeap.java)
  * Binary Search Tree (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/dataStructures/BinarySearchTree.java)
  * Graphs (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/dataStructures/Graph.java)

Algorithms:
--------------------------
Sort:
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Heap Sort (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/algorithms/sort/HeapSort.java)
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort

Search:
  * Binary Search (Arrays, Trees)
  * Sequential Search
  * BFS and DFS For Graphs

Interesting Problems:
-------------------------
  * Finding the relation between two actors (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/dataStructures/ActorMovieRelationModel.java - implemented in One way BFS, later will try to do it in Two way BFS)
  * Calculating the power of a number in log n time  (sampleDataStructures/src/main/java/algorithms/trial/PowerCalculationInLogNTime.java)
  
Whenever you feel there is a possibility / room for improvement, please raise a Pull Request or send me a suggestion. Will be happy to learn and provide the modified Implementation.
